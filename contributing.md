# How To Contribute

## Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to the Ion Wiki. It's people like you that will pave the way for the next wave of Lightning developers and enthusiasts.

Following these guidelines helps to establish a standard for high quality, useful content that will last for years to come. Establishing a nexus of information for the Lightning Network is needed; we're all here to make that happen in an organized, high quality way.

#### What type of contributions we're looking for

Ion is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community!

We're looking for support in the following areas:

* Content creation
* Proofreading
* Improving stub articles
* Content research and roadmapping

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to start? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:

* [Beginner issues - issues which are great to start with](https://github.com/RadarRelay/ionwiki/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
* [Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.](https://github.com/RadarRelay/ionwiki/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

### Never contributed to open source before?

Check out the following resources to get you started. It's way easier than it looks.

* [A Guide to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/)
* [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)
* [How to Make a Pull Request](http://makeapullrequest.com/)

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.

## Getting started

#### How to submit a contribution on GitHub

Start by forking the Ion Wiki repo. From there, either: 

1. Create an article using the [template](https://github.com/RadarRelay/ionwiki/blob/master/template.md) in the root directory
2. Edit or revise existing articles 
3. Move and restructure content

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new pages or structural organization. Some likely examples include the following:

* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Adding notes in raw files for future contributors
* Changes to organizational files like Issue Templates, Contribution Guide, Table of Contents, etc.
* Moving files from one directory to another, restructuring page flow and organization

After committing your changes, make a PR to the main repo and briefly describe your changes.

#### How to contribute via GitBook

Since we're using GitBook to manage our wiki, you can also submit content through the Gitbook GUI.

Start by:

1. Creating an account on GitBook
2. Opening a new draft and editing content in the draft
3. Saving the draft on GitBook with naming conventions

We will be reviewing GitBook contributions with the same pipeline as GitHub contributions. Discussions will be posted in issue threads and PR discussions.

#### Suggestion process

If you find yourself searching for content that doesn't exist in the Ion Wiki, you're probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue on GitHub describing the content you'd like to see, and we'll get on it in our next sprint.

## Review process

The core contributing team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis and discusses content decisions in a weekly triage meeting that we hold in a public Google Hangout. The hangout is announced in the weekly status updates sent in the Ion Wiki developer chat.

After feedback has been given, we anticipate responses within two weeks. After two weeks, we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity. If no feedback is needed, we'll merge the PR and credit you accordingly.

For non-trivial contributions, pull requests should sit for at least 36 hours to ensure that contributors in other timezones have time to review. Consideration should also be given to weekends and other holiday periods to ensure active committers all have reasonable time to become involved in the discussion and review process if they wish.

The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no committer has an objection. During review committers may also request that a specific contributor who is most versed in a particular area takes a look before the PR can be merged. There is no additional "sign off" process for contributions to land. Once all issues brought by committers are addressed it can be landed by any committer.

In the case of an objection being raised in a pull request by another committer, all involved committers should seek to arrive at a consensus by way of addressing concerns being expressed by discussion, compromise on the proposed change, or withdrawal of the proposed change.

If a contribution is controversial and committers cannot agree about how to get it to land or if it should land then it will be escalated to the Ion Core team. Ion members will regularly discuss pending contributions in order to find a resolution. It is expected that only a small minority of issues be brought to the Ion Core team for resolution and that discussion and compromise among committers be the default resolution mechanism.
