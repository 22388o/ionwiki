# Sphinx Packet

## Overview

The Sphinx cryptographic packet format is a compact and provably secure design introduced by George Danezis and Ian Goldberg. It supports a full set of security features: indistinguishable replies, hiding the path length and relay position, detection of tagging attacks and replay attacks, as well as providing unlinkability for each leg of the packetâ€™s journey over the network.

Sphinx is used in `lnd` to relay anonymized messages within the Lightning Network.
