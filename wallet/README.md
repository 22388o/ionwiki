# Wallet

## Overview

A wallet is an app or program that enables you to send and recieve Bitcoin. A Lightning-enabled wallet allows you to interact with the Lightning Network via channels. Wallets keep track of your BTC balance - which is usually held in one or more bitcoin addresses - and your transaction history.
