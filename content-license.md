# How This Content is Licensed

The Ion Wiki uses the **CC-BY-4.0** license to govern our content. Our main priority is to preserve the rights of individuals outside Radar that choose to contribute -- acknowledging their time investment and effort in contributing to such a far-reaching project. 

We also want to prevent the use of the wiki name in a fashion that is not consistent with its branding.

Both of these priorities are best incarnated in the CC-BY license, outlined by [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/).
