# Contribution Overview

Welcome to the Ion Wiki Contributor Guide!

> [If you've never contributed to open source before, click here to watch a short course to give you a primer.](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-introduction-to-github)

If you have something to add, you think that something is missing, or you found something that is incorrect, you have a couple of options.

To contribute to the Ion Wiki, you need an account on GitHub. Then, you can either open an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/radartech/ionwiki/issues). Alternatively, you can edit the documentation yourself.

Have a look at the top contributors to the [wiki here](https://github.com/RadarTech/ionwiki/graphs/contributors?from=2019-01-06&to=2019-01-28&type=c).

## Writing Markdown
GitHub and GitBook automatically renders Markdown files into nice-looking pages. You can edit the files online or locally by cloning this repository.

Here is a couple of [guides to Markdown](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/) from the folks at GitHub.

### Adding to the Table of Content
If you've created a new page and need to add it in the GitBook TOC, edit the [SUMMARY.md file](https://github.com/RadarTech/ionwiki/blob/master/SUMMARY.md).

## Quick edits to existing documents

Quick edits streamline the process to report and fix small errors and omissions in wiki articles. Despite all efforts, small grammar and spelling errors do make their way into our published articles. While you can create issues to report mistakes, it's faster and easier to create a pull request (PR) to fix the issue. Almost every article displays an edit button in the top right of the GUI.

Make your changes in the web editor. You can click the **Preview changes** tab to check the formatting of your change.

Once you have made your changes, scroll to the bottom of the page. Enter a title and description for your PR and click **Propose file change**.

Now that you've proposed your change, you need to ask the owners of the repository to "pull" your changes into their repository. This is done using something called a ["pull request"](https://github.com/RadarTech/ionwiki/tree/master/.contributing/pull-requests.md). When you clicked on **Propose file change** in the figure above, you should have been taken to a new page that looks like the following figure:

Click **Create pull request**, enter a title (and optionally a description) for the pull request, and then click **Create pull request** again.

That's it! Content team members will review and merge your PR. You may get some feedback requesting changes if you made larger changes.

We use PRs for all changes, even for contributors that have write access.

The in-browser editing experience is best for minor or infrequent changes. If you make large contributions, or use advanced Git features (such as branch management or advanced merge conflict resolution), you need to fork the repo and work locally.

## Review open PRs

You can read new topics before they are published by checking the currently open PRs. Reviews follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) process. You can see proposed updates or new articles in public repositories. Review them and add your comments. Look at any of our docs repositories, and check the open pull requests (PRs) for areas that interest you. Community feedback on proposed updates helps the entire community.

## Create quality issues

The wiki is a continuous work in progress. Good issues help us focus our efforts on the highest priorities for the community. The more detail you can provide, the more helpful the issue. Tell us what information you sought. Tell us the search terms you used. If you can't get started, tell us how you want to start exploring unfamiliar technology.

Issues start the conversation about what's needed. The content team will respond to these issues with ideas for what we can add, and ask for your opinions. When we create a draft, we'll ask you to review the PR.
