# Hash

## Overview

A hash algorithm turns an arbitrary amount of data into a fixed-length **hash**. A hash is a fingerprint of the input data, and the same hash will always result from the same data. Like all computer data, hashes are large numbers, and are usually written in hexadecimal.

## Details
