# Preimage

## Overview

In the Lightning Network, a **preimage** is a data string that is passed into a hash function. Preimages are also referred to as 'secrets'. Possession of the relevant preimage allows users to claim [HTLC](hltc.md)s, which is a core process in the routing of payments between nodes.
