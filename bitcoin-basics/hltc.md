# HLTC

## Overview

* A conditional payment between two _peers_: the recipient can spend the payment by presenting its signature and a _payment preimage_, otherwise the payer can cancel the contract by spending it after a given time. These are implemented as outputs from the _commitment transaction_.
* _See container: commitment transaction_
* _See parts: Payment hash, Payment preimage_
