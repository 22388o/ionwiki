# HTLC

## Overview

* A conditional payment between two _peers_: the recipient can spend the payment by presenting its signature and a _payment preimage_, otherwise the payer can cancel the contract by spending it after a given time. These are implemented as outputs from the _commitment transaction_.
* _See container: commitment transaction_
* _See parts: Payment hash, Payment preimage_

Hash Time-Locked Contracts \(HTLCs\) allow transactions to be sent between parties who do not have a direct channels by routing it through multiple hops, so anyone connected to the Lightning Network is part of a single, interconnected global financial system.
