# Digital Signatures

## Overview

_A **digital signature** is a mathematical scheme for demonstrating the authenticity of a digital message or document. A valid digital signature gives a recipient reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender \(authentication\), that the sender cennot deny having sent the message \(nonrepudiation\) and that the message was not altered in transit \(integrity\)._

## Details

### How Digital Signatures Work

_A digital signature consists of two parts. The first part is an algorithm for creating a signature, using a private key \(the signing key\), from a message \(the transaction\). The second part is an algorithm that allows anyone to verify the signature, given also the message and a public key._

_The digital signature algorithm used in bitcoin is the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, or ECDSA._
