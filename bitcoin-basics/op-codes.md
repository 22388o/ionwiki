# Opcodes

## Overview

**Operation codes** originate from the Bitcoin Script language which pushes data or performs functions within a pubkey script or signature script.

## Details

### Pubkey Script

A pubkey script is included in transaction outputs and sets the conditions that must be fulfilled for those satoshis to be spent. Data for fulfilling the conditions can be provided in a signature script. Pubkey Scripts are called a `scriptPubKey` in code.

### Signature Script

A signature script is generated by a spender. Signature scripts are almost always used as variables to satisfy a pubkey script. Signature Scripts are called `scriptSig` in code.
