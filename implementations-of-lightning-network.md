# Implementations \(of lightning network\)

<!-- Use the same title outlined above -->

## Overview

<!--

"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." A couple sentences of non-technical, simple jargon.

(~240 characters)

-->
Participation in the Lightning Network requires running an implementation of a Lightning Network daemon software. This software launchs and runs a unique node that allows communication with other peers on the network. Multiple versions, or implementations, have been created by different entities, just as multiple implementations of core Bitcoin software exist. Different implementations maintain interoperability by conforming to BOLT (Basis of Lightning Technology) standards. 


## Details

<!--
Use this space to explain the protocol, concept, or project. This might include sections such as: Functionality, Features, or Requirements.

Use bullet points, diagrams, code snippets (you can use markdown), etc.

Each section should be >300 words -- and try to keep the article under 5 sections. For extended discussion, link to resources or create another page.
