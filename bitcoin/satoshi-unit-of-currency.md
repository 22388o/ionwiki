# Satoshi \(unit of currency\)

## Overview

A **satoshi** is the smallest unit of the bitcoin currency recorded on the blockchain. Like fiat or physical currency, cryptocurrencies are broken down by denominations, like pennies to a dollar. A satoshi is one hundred millionth of a single bitcoin \(0.00000001 BTC\). The unit has been named in collective homage to the original creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.

### History

On 15 November 2010, [in this post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=369.msg22160#msg22160), ribuck on the Bitcoin Talk forum suggested calling 0.01 BTC a "satoshi". At the time, 0.01 BTC was the smallest unit that could be displayed by the user interface in the standard client, even though the protocol supported eight decimal places.  
  
On 10 February 2011, ribuck proposed [naming the smallest base unit \(0.00000001 BTC\) either an "austrian" or a "satoshi"](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3311.msg46648#msg46648).   
  
Then, on 18 February 2011, marcus\_of\_augustus [posted](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3574.msg50647#msg50647) "100 million satoshis = 1 bitcoin. Are we agreed?" to which someone responded "affirmative", and the usage caught on.  
  
Satoshi Nakamoto referred to the base unit simply as a "coin" in his writings.
